## What is it for?
foldermaker is an application that creates a workspace for you every-day files (memos, drafts, downloads etc). This is a place to put your files that is
1.	Away from your desktop, reducing clutter
2.	A means of organising your work by date helping you recall what you were doing and when
3.	An archive for potentially useful material
When the question comes up “Hey, you worked on that project last March, do you still have those image files we used?”. The answer will (partly) be, “Sure! I’ll just search last March’s folder”.

## What does it do?
It creates a folder every day, in a ‘ddMMyyyy’ format in the user My Document folder. That is to say...

It creates a folder in MyDocs for the current year, then it creates a folder for the month, then it creates a folder for the day of that month. It also adds a shortcut to the desktop.

viz;
